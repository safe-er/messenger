# Messenger page clone

This is a clone of the Messenger website. It has many _mindblowing_ features such as:

- A sticky navbar
- Login input field
- An uncompleted footer :)

> I gave up when doing the footer as I literally just couldn't get rid of the empty space at the bottom.

## Video

## Open the website
I have hosted this website, however, **Chrome and some other browsers** have marked my website as ***dangerous.*** This is false, as I have no viruses on it. You can literally **check the code** lol.
